# Bowbound

_Read this in other languages: [English](./README.md), [Português (Brasil)](./README.pt-BR.md)_

Bowbound is a 2D platform game built with PyGame that tests your agility, aim and problem solving skills. Control an archer and, using your bow and different arrows, hit all the targets in the level to be able to use the level's exit door. Each level has a limited number of arrows and different types of arrows behave in different ways, so use them wisely!

The game was built as the final project of the Object Oriented Programming II (INE5404) course taught by professors [Jônata Tyska](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonata-tyska-phd/) and [Mateus Grellert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateus-grellert-29503356/) of the Computer Science major at the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC).

Internally, the Bowbound was developed based on Object-Oriented concepts. It also implements different design patterns (such as Singleton, Data Access Object, States), which, combined with OOP, promotes code reusability and project maintainability. See more about implementation details in the [development report](./UML/Relat%C3%B3rio%20de%20Desenvolvimento.pdf). See the project class diagram in [UML](./UML/Diagrama%20de%20Classes.pdf).
