Bowbound is a 2D platform game built with PyGame that tests your agility, aim and problem solving skills. Control an archer and, using your bow and different arrows, hit all the targets in the level to be able to use the level's exit door. Each level has a limited number of arrows and different types of arrows behave in different ways, so use them wisely!
